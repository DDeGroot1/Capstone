# Capstone
I am uploading several files. A few of them are saved models that I will get sorted out in this text document. 
The modeling file is called "CapStone.ipynb" or "Capstone.py"

The file will download a zip folder called "Archive" to your working directory that contains the 9,000 images (3G).
